            Xiangqi (pronounced “shiang-chee”) has been played for hundreds of
            years and is today still one of the most popular board games in the
            world, played in China and across Asia, and recently, in the West as
            well. You can usually find men playing xiangqi in Chinatown
            neighborhoods across the world.
